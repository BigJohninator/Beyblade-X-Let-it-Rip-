# Beyblade-X-Let-it-Rip-
One of my first high effort terraria mods, with a central theme around beyblades!
i mostly used basic tutorials to create the beys but as time prohgressed i began to be able to make much more unique additions to my mod.
you will need a copy of terraria for this
i don't think i could put everything into my repository so you will likely have to use the steam workshop to get my mod
i will update this after my long hiatus from playing silksong or smth
